      <description>&lt;p&gt;Should we really believe that a cat can be both dead and alive because ‘science’ told us so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you telling me that everything we ever have and ever will see in this gigantic Universe was once squashed into a point smaller than an atom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we try to look into the scientific reasoning and explanations for why these absurd conclusions could be true, they’re often shrouded in a black box of equations and jargon that really doesn’t feel like it’s worth the time to understand completely. At least that’s how I feel about my reading assignments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
